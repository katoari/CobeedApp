## Getting Started

Cobeed App: Your personal quarantine assistant.

Cobeed App books an appointment with a certified affiliate doctor that will check patients,
if they have concerns regarding their health to see whether they are really infected with the disease. 
This will ensure the PUQâ€™s queries thus keeping the system of handling COVID patients in the area in an organized manner.
It allows users to post their Quarantine or COVID stories. Which can be viewed by other users as well. 
But users must create or have an existing account to be able to share their stories.
